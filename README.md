# Magento 2 Extension: "Dynamic SKU" by Movatech

## Overview 
Dynamic SKU extension dynamically updates SKUs of configurable products on the front-end basing on their color, size, and other options. By default, Magento 2 doesn’t change SKU on the front-end when a user selects one of the product’s options. The lack of this feature complicates shopping for customers and order processing for store admins. 

Dynamic SKU extension is perfect for online stores that sell products with a large number of options. Imagine selling custom goods. Each item can have more than 10 options to choose from, starting from brand and length to color or weight of some part. When a customer contacts a store manager, the person has to name all the selected options, and the admin has to find the right SKU in the catalog. Our extension allows saving time both for shoppers and managers as it updates SKUs on the front-end considering all the selected product’s options.     

## Features 
1. Automatically changes SKUs on the front-end when users select the product’s options.
1. Works immediately upon the installation, you don’t need to activate it in your admin panel.

## Key Benefits
- Fast order management
